This contains PKGBUILDs for Compiz 0.8.x, taken from the Arch Linux community
repos right before its removal.

I've patched and compiled them both for 32/64 bit (x86).

### Structure

`build` -- `PKGBUILD` scripts.

`src` -- Source archives downloaded by build scripts.

`pkg` -- Compiled Pacman packages.
